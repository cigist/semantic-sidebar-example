# Semantic UI Reactive Sidebars

Let's say you're using Semantic UI and you want a sidebar that is reactive, turning into a button-toggled menu when the page gets small.
The examples on Semantic UIs docs are all super complicated and involve having *two* copies of your menu setup.

This repo demonstrates a better way.

You can try it out at https://itamarst.github.io/semantic-sidebar-example/ - try shrinking the window to see how it's reactive.
